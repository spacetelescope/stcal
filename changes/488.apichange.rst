Change ``calc_pixmap`` in ``alignment.resample_utils`` to match the version in ``drizzle.utils`` and then add interpolation options to speed up resampling calculations.  Coordinate transformations can dominate the runtime of ``resample`` and, for well-behaved distortion corrections, they may be sped up by a factor of several tens with negligible loss of accuracy.  Propagate interpolation options to ``gwcs_blot`` and ``Resample``.
