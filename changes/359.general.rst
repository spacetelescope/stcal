The changes are:

- handle "ivm" and "ivm-sky" cases identically:

    - for "ivm": calculate 1/var_rnoise, setting non-finite to 0, and if
      missing or shape mismatch, return all ones (equal weighting);

    - for "ivm-sky": calculate 1/var_sky, setting non-finite to 0, and if
      missing or shape mismatch, return all ones (equal weighting);

- always multiply the result by the DQ mask;

- the fallback for a missing variance array is an array filled with ones (equal
  weighting).
