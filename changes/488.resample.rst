Enhanced ``calc_pixmap`` version from ``drizzle.utils`` by adding interpolation options to speed up resampling calculations.  Coordinate transformations can dominate the runtime of ``resample`` and, for well-behaved distortion corrections, computing pixmap by interpolating over fewer points significantly reduce computing time with negligible loss of accuracy depending on chosen order and step size.
