Changed the default `ramp fitting` CI test algorithm to ``OLS_C``.  This also revealed
a bug in control flow that allowed for the CHARGELOSS recalculation in error, which
resulted in a crash while attempting to dereference a ``NULL`` pointer.  Further, when
creating the optional results product, the object creation was changed to `PyArray_ZEROS`
to ensure invalid data was set to zero.  The use of `PyArray_EMPTY` does not initialize
memory, so junk data could be in used array elements.
