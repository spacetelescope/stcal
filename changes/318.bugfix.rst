This PR fixes JP-3791, JP-3771, and JP-3708.  For `ramp_fitting`, the
`CRMAG` element was not originally implementd in the C-extension for
ramp fitting.  It is now implemented.  The bug the read noise recalculation
for CHARGELOSS when using the multiprocessing option has been fixed.  Further,
in `JWST` regression tests have been added to test for multiprocessing to
ensure testing for anything that could affect multiprocessing.
