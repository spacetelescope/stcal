JP-3791: Fixed the `ramp fitting` multiprocessing portion of the 
         CHARGELOSS recomputation of the readnoise variances.  The
         DQ array wasn't properly sliced and distributed to the
         multiple processes to properly do the recompute.  This is
         now properly sliced for distribution.

JP-3771: Added multiple regression tests to the JWST repo.  The tests
         test multiprocessing in the `jump` step and `ramp_step` and
         ensure the outout is the same as during single processing.
         This is done by running the same tests as currently being done,
         but selecting multiprocessing and comparing output files that
         are used for single processing as well.  There is an additional
         ramp fit multiprocessing test that also saves the optional results
         product.

JP-3708: Added the CRMAG array to the optional results product in `ramp_fit`.
         This element of the optional results product had not previously been
         implemented in the C-extension.
