For `ramp_fitting`, the `CRMAG` element was not originally implemented in
the C-extension for ramp fitting.  It is now implemented.  A bug in the read
noise recalculation for CHARGELOSS when using the multiprocessing option has
been fixed.  Further, in `JWST` regression tests have been added to test for
multiprocessing to ensure testing for anything that could affect multiprocessing.
