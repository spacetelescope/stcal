Description
===========

Overview
--------
This step takes as input image catalogs of point-like sources,
which are used to compute corrections to the WCS of
the input images such that sky catalogs obtained from the
image catalogs using the corrected WCS will align on the sky.

Source Catalogs
---------------
The input catalog must be in a format automatically recognized by
`~astropy.table.Table.read`. The catalog must contain
either ``'x'`` and ``'y'`` or ``'xcentroid'`` and ``'ycentroid'`` columns which
indicate source *image* coordinates (in pixels). Pixel coordinates are
0-indexed. An optional column in the catalog is the ``'weight'`` column,
which when present, will be used in fitting.

Relative Alignment
------------------
Relative alignment is performed by
the `~stcal.tweakreg.relative_align` function.
The source catalogs for each input image are compared to each other
and linear (affine) coordinate transformations that align these
catalogs are derived.  This fit ensures that all the input images
are aligned relative to each other.  This step produces a combined
source catalog for the entire set of input images as if they were
combined into a single mosaic.

Absolute Alignment
------------------

Absolute alignment is performed by
the `~stcal.tweakreg.absolute_align` function.
If the parameter ``abs_refcat`` is set to 'GAIADR3', 'GAIADR2', or 'GAIADR1',
an astrometric reference catalog then gets generated by querying
a GAIA-based astrometric catalog web service for all astrometrically
measured sources in the combined field-of-view of the set of input
images. This catalog is generated from the catalogs available
through the `STScI MAST Catalogs`_ and has the ability to account
for proper motion to a given epoch. The epoch is computed from the observation date and time
of the input data.

.. _STScI MAST Catalogs: https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDATA/Catalog+Access

The combined source catalog
then gets cross-matched and fit to this astrometric reference catalog.
The pipeline initially supports fitting to the
GAIADR3 catalog, with the option to select the GAIADR2 or GAIADR1 instead.
The results of this one fit then gets back-propagated to all the
input images to align them all to the astrometric reference frame while
maintaining the relative alignment between the images.

For this part of alignment, instead of 'GAIADR1', 'GAIADR2', or 'GAIADR3', users can
supply an external reference catalog by providing a path to an existing
file. A user-supplied catalog must contain ``'RA'`` and ``'DEC'`` columns
indicating reference source world coordinates (in degrees). An optional column
in the catalog is the ``'weight'`` column, which when present, will be used
in fitting. The catalog must be in a format automatically recognized by
`~astropy.table.Table.read`.

Grouping
--------

Images taken at the same time (e.g., NIRCam images from all short-wave
detectors) can be aligned together; that is, a single correction
can be computed and applied to all these images because any error in
telescope pointing will be identical in all these images and it is assumed
that the relative positions of (e.g., NIRCam) detectors do not change.
Identification of images that belong to the same "exposure" and therefore
can be grouped together is based on several attributes
*change from here to end of section* described in
`~jwst.datamodels.ModelContainer`. This grouping is performed automatically
in the ``tweakreg`` step using the
`~jwst.datamodels.ModelContainer.models_grouped` property, which assigns
a group ID to each input image model in ``meta.group_id``.

However, when detector calibrations are not accurate, alignment of groups
of images may fail (or result in poor alignment). In this case, it may be
desirable to align each image independently. This can be achieved either by
setting the ``image_model.meta.group_id`` attribute to a unique string or integer
value for each image, or by adding the ``group_id`` attribute to the ``members`` of the input ASN
table - see `~jwst.datamodels.ModelContainer` for more details.

.. note::
    Group ID (``group_id``) is used by both ``tweakreg`` and ``skymatch`` steps
    and so modifying it for one step will affect the results in another step.
    If it is desirable to apply different grouping strategies to the ``tweakreg``
    and ``skymatch`` steps, one may need to run each step individually and
    provide a different ASN as input to each step.

WCS Correction
--------------
The linear coordinate transformation computed in the previous step
is used to define tangent-plane corrections that need to be applied
to the GWCS pipeline in order to correct input image WCS.
This correction is implemented by inserting a ``v2v3corr`` frame with
tangent plane corrections into the GWCS pipeline of the image's WCS.

Arguments
---------
The ``tweakreg`` step has the following optional arguments:


**Relative alignment parameters:**

Parameters used for relative alignment between input images. These parameters
are passed into the `~stcal.tweakreg.relative_align` function.

* ``expand_refcat``: A boolean indicating whether or not to expand reference
  catalog with new sources from other input images that have been already
  aligned to the reference image. (Default=False)

* ``minobj``: A positive `int` indicating minimum number of objects acceptable
  for matching. (Default=15)

* ``searchrad``: A `float` indicating the search radius in arcsec for a match.
  (Default=2.0)

* ``use2dhist``: A boolean indicating whether to use 2D histogram to find
  initial offset. (Default=True)

* ``separation``: Minimum object separation in arcsec. It **must be** at least
  ``sqrt(2)`` times larger than ``tolerance``. (Default=1.0)

* ``tolerance``: Matching tolerance for ``xyxymatch`` in arcsec. (Default=0.7)

* ``xoffset``: Initial guess for X offset in arcsec. (Default=0.0)

* ``yoffset``: Initial guess for Y offset in arcsec. (Default=0.0)

* ``fitgeometry``: A `str` value indicating the type of affine transformation
  to be considered when fitting catalogs. Allowed values:

  - ``'shift'``: x/y shifts only
  - ``'rshift'``: rotation and shifts
  - ``'rscale'``: rotation and scale
  - ``'general'``: shift, rotation, and scale

  The default value is "rshift".

  .. note::
      Mathematically, alignment of images observed in different tangent planes
      requires ``fitgeometry='general'`` in order to fit source catalogs
      in the different images even if misalignment is caused only by a shift
      or rotation in the tangent plane of one of the images.

      However, under certain circumstances, such as small alignment errors or
      minimal dithering during observations that keep tangent planes of the
      images to be aligned almost parallel, then it may be more robust to
      use a ``fitgeometry`` setting with fewer degrees of freedom such as
      ``'rshift'``, especially for "ill-conditioned" source catalogs such as
      catalogs with very few sources, or large errors in source positions, or
      sources placed along a line or bunched in a corner of the image (not
      spread across/covering the entire image).

* ``nclip``: A non-negative integer number of clipping iterations
  to use in the fit. (Default=3)

* ``sigma``: A positive `float` indicating the clipping limit, in sigma units,
  used when performing fit. (Default=3.0)

**Absolute Astrometric fitting parameters:**

Parameters used for absolute astrometry to a reference catalog.
These parameters
are passed into the `~stcal.tweakreg.absolute_align` function.

* ``abs_refcat``: String indicating what astrometric catalog should be used.
  Currently supported options: 'GAIADR1', 'GAIADR2', 'GAIADR3', a path to an existing
  reference catalog, `None`, or `''`. See
  `stcal.tweakreg.tweakreg.SINGLE_GROUP_REFCAT`
  for an up-to-date list of supported built-in reference catalogs.

  When ``abs_refcat`` is `None` or an empty string, alignment to the
  absolute astrometry catalog will be turned off.
  (Default= `''`)

* ``abs_minobj``: A positive `int` indicating minimum number of objects
  acceptable for matching. (Default=15)

* ``abs_searchrad``: A `float` indicating the search radius in arcsec for
  a match. It is recommended that a value larger than ``searchrad`` be used for
  this parameter (e.g. 3 times larger) (Default=6.0)

* ``abs_use2dhist``: A boolean indicating whether to use 2D histogram to find
  initial offset. It is strongly recommended setting this parameter to `True`.
  Otherwise the initial guess for the offsets will be set to zero
  (Default=True)

* ``abs_separation``: Minimum object separation in arcsec. It **must be** at
  least ``sqrt(2)`` times larger than ``abs_tolerance``. (Default=1.0)

* ``abs_tolerance``: Matching tolerance for ``xyxymatch`` in arcsec.
  (Default=0.7)

* ``abs_fitgeometry``: A `str` value indicating the type of affine
  transformation to be considered when fitting catalogs. Allowed values:

  - ``'shift'``: x/y shifts only
  - ``'rshift'``: rotation and shifts
  - ``'rscale'``: rotation and scale
  - ``'general'``: shift, rotation, and scale

  The default value is "rshift". Note that the same conditions/restrictions
  that apply to ``fitgeometry`` also apply to ``abs_fitgeometry``.

* ``abs_nclip``: A non-negative integer number of clipping iterations
  to use in the fit. (Default=3)

* ``abs_sigma``: A positive `float` indicating the clipping limit, in sigma
  units, used when performing fit. (Default=3.0)

* ``save_abs_catalog``: A boolean specifying whether or not to write out the
  astrometric catalog used for the fit as a separate product. (Default=False)
