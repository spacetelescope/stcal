    Short Summary
    -------------
    Apply flagging for saturation based on threshold values stored in the
    saturation reference file data `sat_thresh` and A/D floor based on testing
    for 0 DN values. For A/D floor flagged groups, the DO_NOT_USE flag is also
    set.

    Parameters

    data : float, 4D array
        science array

    gdq : int, 4D array
        group dq array

    pdq : int, 2D array

    sat_thresh : `np.array`
        Pixel-wise threshold for saturation, same shape `data`

    sat_dq : `np.array`
        data quality flags associated with `sat_thresh`

    dqflags : dict
        A dictionary with at least the following keywords:
        DO_NOT_USE, SATURATED, AD_FLOOR, NO_SAT_CHECK

    n_pix_grow_sat : int
        Number of pixels that each flagged saturated pixel should be 'grown',
        to account for charge spilling. Default is 1.
