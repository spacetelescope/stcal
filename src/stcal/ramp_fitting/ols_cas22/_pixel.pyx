    Class to contain the data to fit ramps for a single pixel.
        This data is drawn from for all ramps for a single pixel.

    fixed : FixedValues
        The object containing all the values and metadata which is fixed for a
        given read pattern>
    read_noise : float
        The read noise for the given pixel
    resultants : float [:]
        Resultants input for the given pixel

    local_slopes : float [:, :]
        These are the local slopes between the resultants for the pixel.
            single difference local slope:
                local_slopes[Diff.single, :] = (resultants[i+1] - resultants[i])
                                                / (t_bar[i+1] - t_bar[i])

    var_read_noise : float [:, :]
        The read noise variance term of the jump statistics
            single difference read noise variance:
                var_read_noise[Diff.single, :] = read_noise * ((1/n_reads[i+1]) + (1/n_reads[i]))

    Notes
    -----
    - local_slopes and var_read_noise are only computed if use_jump is True. 
      These values represent reused computations for jump detection which are
      used by every ramp for the given pixel for jump detection. They are
      computed once and stored for reuse by all ramp computations for the pixel.
    - The computations are done using vectorized operations for some performance
      increases. However, this is marginal compaired with the performance increase
      from pre-computing the values and reusing them.

    Methods
    -------
    fit_ramp (ramp_index) : method
        Compute the ramp fit for a single ramp defined by an inputed RampIndex
    fit_ramps (ramp_stack) : method
        Compute all the ramps for a single pixel using the Casertano+22 algorithm
