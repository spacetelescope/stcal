- Pin astropy min version to 5.0.4. [#82]

0.6.2 (22-03-29)
================

jump
----
- Neighboring pixels with 'SATURATION' or 'DONOTUSE' flags are no longer flagged as jumps. [#79]

0.6.1 (22-03-04)
================

ramp_fitting
------------

- Adding feature to suppress calculations for saturated ramps having only

================

ramp_fitting
------------

- Adding GLS code back to ramp fitting. [#64]

jump
----

  fixed some of the logging statements in twopoint difference. [#74]

0.5.1 (2022-01-07)
==================

jump
----

- fixes to several existing errors in the jump detection step. added additional

------------

- Moved dark current code from JWST to STCAL. [#63]

==================

linearity
---------
- Let software set the pixel dq flag to NO_LIN_CORR if linear term of linearity coefficient is zero. [#65]

==================

ramp_fitting
------------

- For slopes with negative median rates, the Poisson variance is zero. [#59]
