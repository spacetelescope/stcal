jump
~~~~

- Switch multiprocessing method to ``fork_server``. [#249]

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Switch multiprocessing method to ``fork_server``. [#249]

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~

- Updated the shower flagging code to mask reference pixels, require a minimum
  number of groups to trigger the detection, and use all integrations to determine
  the median value. [#248]

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed the data type of three variables that are used in measuring
  the jump free segments of integrations. The variables were uint8 and
  they would yield wrong results for integrations with more than 256
  groups. [#251]

- Use ``sqrtf`` instead of ``sqrt`` in ols_cas22 ramp fitting with
  jump detection to avoid small numerical errors on different systems
  due to a cast to/from double. [#252]


Other
-----

jump
~~~~

- Enable the use of multiple integrations to find outliers. Also,
  when the number of groups is above a threshold, use single pass
  outlier flagging rather than the iterative flagging. [#242]

- Use ``sqrtf`` instead of ``sqrt`` in ols_cas22 ramp fitting with
  jump detection to avoid small numerical errors on different systems
  due to a cast to/from double. [#252]

1.6.1 (2024-02-29)
==================

Changes to API
--------------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.6.0 (2024-02-15)
==================

Changes to API
--------------

jump
~~~~

- Add in the flagging of groups in the integration after a snowball
  occurs. The saturated core of the snowball gets flagged as jump
  for a number of groups passed in as a parameter [#238]

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~

- Fixed the computation of the number of rows per slice for multiprocessing, which
  was causing different results when running the step with multiprocess [#239]

- Fix the code to at least always flag the group with the shower and the requested
  groups after the primary shower. [#237]

1.4.3 (2023-09-13)
==================

Changes to API
--------------

saturation
~~~~~~~~~~

- Added read_pattern argument to flag_saturated_pixels.  When used,
  this argument adjusts the saturation group-by-group to handle
  different numbers of frames entering different groups for Roman.
  When not set, the original behavior is preserved. [#188]

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed failures with Numpy 2.0. [#210, #211]

Other
-----

jump
~~~~

- enable the detection of snowballs that occur in frames that are
  within a group. [#207]

- Added more allowable selections for the number of cores to use for
  multiprocessing [#183]

- Fixed the computation of the number of rows per slice for multiprocessing,
  which caused different results when running the step with multiprocess [#239]

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added more allowable selections for the number of cores to use for
  multiprocessing [#183]

- Updating variance computation for invalid integrations, as well as
  updating the median rate computation by excluding groups marked as
  DO_NOT_USE. [#208]

- Implement the Casertano, et.al, 2022 uneven ramp fitting [#175]

1.4.2 (2023-07-11)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~

  mode. This is the value that is put into the header keyword EXTNCRS. [#178]

1.4.1 (2023-06-29)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~

- Added setting of number_extended_events for non-multiprocessing
  mode. This is the value that is put into the header keyword EXTNCRS. [#178]

1.4.1 (2023-06-29)

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~

- Added statement to prevent the number of cores used in multiprocessing from
  being larger than the number of rows. This was causing some CI tests to fail. [#176]

1.4.0 (2023-06-27)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~

- Updated the jump detection to switch to using the numpy sigmaclip routine to
  find the actual rms across integrations when there are at least 101 integrations
  in the exposure. This still allows cosmic rays and snowballs/showers to be flagged
  without being affected by slope variations due to either brigher-fatter/charge-spilling
  or errors in the nonlinearity correction.
  Also added the counting of the number of cosmic rays and snowballs/showers that
  is then placed in the FITS header in the JWST routines. [#174]

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changing where time division occurs during ramp fitting in order to
  properly handle special cases where the time is not group time, such
  as when ZEROFRAME data is used, so the time is frame time. [#173]

- Added another line of code to be included in the section where warnings are turned
  off. The large number of warnings can cause a hang in the Jupyter notebook when
  running with multiprocessing. [#174]

1.3.8 (2023-05-31)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

dark_current
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed handling of MIRI segmented data files so that the correct dark
  integrations get subtracted from the correct science integrations. [#165]

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Correct the "averaging" of the final image slope by properly excluding
  variances as a part of the denominator from integrations with invalid slopes.
  [#167]
- Removing the usage of ``numpy.where`` where possible for performance
  reasons. [#169]

1.3.7 (2023-04-26)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Correctly compute the number of groups in a segment to properly compute the
  optimal weights for the OLS ramp fitting algorithm.  Originally, this
  computation had the potential to include groups not in the segment being
  computed. [#163]

Changes to API
--------------

- Drop support for Python 3.8 [#162]

1.3.6 (2023-04-19)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``meta`` tag was missing when checking for ``drop_frame1``.  It has been
  added to the check. [#161]


Changes to API
--------------

-

Other
-----

- Remove use of deprecated ``pytest-openfiles`` ``pytest`` plugin. This has been replaced by
  catching ``ResourceWarning``. [#159]


1.3.5 (2023-03-30)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~

- Updated the code for both NIR Snowballs and MIRI Showers. The snowball
  flagging will now extend the saturated core of snowballs. Also,
  circles are no longer used for snowballs preventing the huge circles
  of flagged pixels from a glancing CR.
  Shower code is completely new and is now able to find extended
  emission far below the single pixel SNR. It also allows detected
  showers to flag groups after the detection. [#144]

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- During multiprocessing, if the number of processors requested are greater
  than the number of rows in the image, then ramp fitting errors out.  To
  prevent this error, during multiprocessing, the number of processors actually
  used will be no greater than the number of rows in the image. [#154]

Other
~~~~~

- Remove the ``dqflags``, ``dynamicdq``, and ``basic_utils`` modules and replace
  them with thin imports from ``stdatamodels`` where the code as been moved. [#146]

- update minimum version of ``numpy`` to ``1.20`` and add minimum dependency testing to CI [#153]

- restore ``opencv-python`` to a hard dependency [#155]

1.3.4 (2023-02-13)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed computations for ramps that have only one good group in the 0th
  group.  Ramps that have a non-zero groupgap should not use group_time, but
  (NFrames+1)*TFrame/2, instead. [#142]

1.3.3 (2023-01-26)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed zeros that should be NaNs in rate and rateints product and suppressed
  a cast warning due to attempts to cast NaN to an integer. [#141]

Changes to API
--------------

dark
----

- Modified dark class to support quantities in Roman.[#140]

1.3.2 (2023-01-10)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed a cast due to numpy deprecation that now throws a warning.  The
  negation of a DQ flag then cast to a np.uint32 caused an over flow.  The
  flag is now cast to a np.uint32 before negation. [#139]


1.3.1 (2023-01-03)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- improve exception handling when attempting to use ellipses without ``opencv-python`` installed [#136]

==================

General
-------

- use ``tox`` environments [#130]

--------------

- Added support for Quantities in models required for the RomanCAL
  pipeline. [#124]

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Set values in the rate and rateints product to NaN when no usable data is
  available to compute slopes. [#131]


1.2.2 (2022-12-01)
==================

General
-------

- Moved build configuration from ``setup.cfg`` to ``pyproject.toml`` to support PEP621 [#95]

- made dependency on ``opencv-python`` conditional [#126]


ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Set saturation flag only for full saturation.  The rateints product will
  have the saturation flag set for an integration only if saturation starts
  in group 0.  The rate product will have the saturation flag set only if
  each integration for a pixel is marked as fully saturated. [#125]

1.2.1 (2022-10-14)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

jump
~~~~
- Changes to limit the expansion of MIRI shower ellipses to be the same
  number of pixels for both the major and minor axis. JP-2944 [#123]

==================

Bug Fixes
---------

dark_current
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  use on-board frame averaging and/or group gaps. [#121]

jump
~~~~

- Changes to flag both NIR snowballs and MIRI showers
  for  JP-#2645. [#118]

- Early in the step, the object arrays are converted from DN to electrons
  by multiplying by the gain. The values need to be reverted back to DN
  at the end of the step. [#116]

1.1.0 (2022-08-17)
==================

General
-------

- Made style changes due to the new 5.0.3 version of flake8, which
  noted many missing white spaces after keywords. [#114]

Bug Fixes
---------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updating multi-integration processing to correctly combine multiple
  integration computations for the final image information. [#108]

- Fixed crash due to two group ramps with saturated groups that used
  an intermediate array with an incorrect shape. [#109]

- Updating how NaNs and DO_NOT_USE flags are handled in the rateints
  product. [#112]

- Updating how GLS handles bad gain values.  NaNs and negative gain
  values have the DO_NOT_USE and NO_GAIN_VALUE flag set.  Any NaNs
  found in the image data are set to 0.0 and the corresponding DQ flag
  is set to DO_NOT_USE. [#115]

Changes to API
--------------

jump
~~~~

 - Added flagging after detected ramp jumps based on two DN thresholds and
   two number of groups to flag [#110]

  multiprocessing, as well as fixing the multiprocessing failure. [#99]

- Changing how ramp fitting handles fully saturated ramps. [#102]

saturation
~~~~~~~~~~

- Modified the saturation threshold applied to pixels flagged with
  NO_SAT_CHECK, so that they never get flagged as saturated. [#106]

Changes to API
--------------

ramp_fitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The tuple ``integ_info`` no longer returns ``int_times`` as a part of it,
  so the tuple is one element shorter. [#99]

- For fully saturated exposures, all returned values are ``None``, instead
  of tuples. [#102]

saturation
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changing parameter name in twopoint_difference from 'normal_rej_thresh' to rejection_thresh' for consistency. [#105]
